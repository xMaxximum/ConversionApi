# ConversionApi

This is an API that is supposed to provide useful conversions utilizing microservices and docker for different types of tasks. Soon I will also add a frontend and clean some things up.

## Note
The ffmpeg binaries don't fit on github so you'll have to download them yourself in the AudioService project. I will try to find a solution for this as I will add more microservices.
